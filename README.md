# Timberwolf

A simple Paper plugin that allows you to chop trees by simply chopping the bottom block.

No one's perfect, so this plugin includes the ability to undo chopping a tree that you accidentally removed. Just type `/undochop`. You'll need to have enough of the correct type of logs in your inventory for this to work. The permission for this command is `timberwolf.undochop`.

You can build this plugin with Maven:

`mvn install` and get the generated jarfile from `target/`.
